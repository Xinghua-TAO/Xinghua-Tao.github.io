Hi there! I am a researcher in M.D. Anderson Cancer Center working with [Prof. Wenyi Wang][1]. Prior to joining M.D.Anderson, I received my B.A. from Peking University in 2019 and received my M.S. from the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2021.

I am now working on bulk miRNA deconvolution. miRNAs play important roles in gene regulation, and their dysregulation is implicated in human diseases including cancer. However, there is few tool created to deconvolute bulk miRNA data. My current work is about filling this gap.

Outside of the lab, I love taking funny photos of my cat, playing with my cello, baking, and dancing the Argentine tango! Besides, I am running a Youtube Chanel, [Hi R][2], teaching people how to use R to do data analysis. If you are interested, take a look at it!
